JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.

Writing into the HTML output using document.write().

Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().

Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.

The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).
